Several individuals deserve recognition for their help in this work. First, I am greatly indebted to Dr. Ginger Lockhart for giving me the opportunity to find where my research passions are---especially quantitatively. She provided guidance in my budding career with the right amount of understanding and pressure to push me to be a more productive and capable researcher. I also owe a great deal to Dr. Jamison Fargo who pushed for me to get into the program when my application was delayed. He has also provent to be an important mentor and friend. Relatedly, I am grateful to Dr. Karl White in allowing me to become his first student in many years (hopefully he does not regret it!), providing opportunities to develop as a researcher in an important field. 

My friends and colleagues in the program are also deserve serious recognition for their help and support. Specifically, Emily Brignone played an invaluable role as a leader and friend as I pursued my goals in the program. Given she was a year ahead of me in the program, she provided timely and important help throughout the process. I appreciate her loyal, honest, genuine friendship. Other good friend that deserved mentioning is Sara Doutre, who also provided support and laughs when I needed it (and sometimes when I did not need it but still welcomed it!). Other colleagues...

I also want to acknowledge my committee, in providing feedback, guidance, and support throughout my graduate student life. The department's and college's administrative staff and heads, although working in the background, were a huge help in getting me to where I am today. Finally, Utah State University as a school has proven to be a fantastic place to grow academically and to mature into a capable researcher.
